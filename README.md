Blokus is an abstract strategy board game for two to four players, where players try to score points by occupying most of the board with pieces of their colour. It was first released in 2000. 

It can be a two- or four-player game. 
Each player has 21 pieces of a different color. 
The board is typically divided into 20 columns and 20 rows, but smaller two-player versions are 14x14.
